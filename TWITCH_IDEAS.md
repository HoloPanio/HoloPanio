# Uganda API

This will be the API that I use to interface with all of my twitch applications.  When I create a new utility to use with my twitch account, I will route it through the uganda API.

## Donations
I will create a custom donation page.  I would do this to allow as many payment souces.  Through this donation api I would accept stripe as well as crypto currencies.

## DogeHouse Integration
I will have a twitch layout opject that would interface with the dogehouse api directly allowing me to put the dogehouse room on my stream when I am streaming.
